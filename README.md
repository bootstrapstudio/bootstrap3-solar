# The Solar Bootstrap 3 Theme

The Solar theme was originally developed for [Bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch), but never became part of an official release and was eventually dropped. 

This is the fork of Solar we use in [Bootstrap Studio](https://bootstrapstudio.io/). It is updated to support Bootstrap 3.4.1.
